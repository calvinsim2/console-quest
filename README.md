# Console Quest

## Introduction
A simple and straightforward adventure game played entirely through console interactions.

## Motivation

ConsoleQuest was created to offer a classic command-line interaction game, intentionally designed without a graphical user interface. This simple project aims to help aspiring ASP.NET developers focus solely on backend logic development, allowing them to gain a solid understanding of how data flows between the application and domain services. The project also serves as a hands-on opportunity to explore well-known creational design patterns, such as the Factory Method and Builder patterns. Each stage of the game is built using a decision tree, where small, incremental decisions are made step by step, guiding the progression. This approach helps developers deepen their understanding and practical application of these design patterns through direct experience.

## Prerequisites

1. **.NET 6 SDK**  
   Make sure you have the .NET 6 SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the official .NET website:
