# Console Quest

## Introduction
A simple and straightforward adventure game that is solely interactable via console.

## Motivation

ConsoleQuest was created to offer a straightforward, retro-style command-line interaction game with no graphical user interface, allowing aspiring ASP.NET developers to concentrate entirely on backend logic. The project's design emphasizes understanding how data flows between the application and domain services, providing a practical learning experience. Additionally, it incorporates well-known Creational Design Patterns, such as Factory Method and Builder, giving developers an opportunity to apply these patterns hands-on and deepen their comprehension through practical implementation.
